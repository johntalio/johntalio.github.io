		<h2 class="middle">About <cite>Shadow</cite></h2>
			<p>Throughout the game, little information is given to the player concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another. The game takes place in a fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast, unpopulated region, known as the Forbidden Land. Aptly, the Forbidden Land is physically isolated from the outside world by such geographical features as mountain ranges and oceans; the only things that inhabit the Forbidden Land are ancient ruins, crumbling structures, and, of course, the powerful colossi.</p>

		<h3 class="end">The Characters</h3>
			<p>The protagonist of the game is <b>Wander</b>, although he is never mentioned by name throughout the entire course of the game. He has traveled to the Forbidden Land to kill sixteen colossi in order to resurrect <b>Mono</b>, a maiden who was somehow sacrificed because she was believed to have a cursed destiny. Guided by a mysterious, disembodied entity called <b>Dormin</b>, who is rumored to have the ability to revive the dead, Wander must search the expansive, unknown region accompanied only by his faithful horse <b>Agro</b> for the colossi. The player meets only a few other characters during the game.</p>
